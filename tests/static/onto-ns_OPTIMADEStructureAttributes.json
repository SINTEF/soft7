Species can represent pure chemical elements, virtual-crystal atoms representing a statistical occupation of a given site by multiple chemical elements, and/or a location to which there are attached atoms, i.e., atoms whose precise location are unknown beyond that they are attached to that position (frequently used to indicate hydrogen atoms attached to another element, e.g., a carbon with three attached hydrogens might represent a methyl group, -CH3)."},"species_at_sites":{"type":"string","shape":["nsites"],"description":"Name of the species at each site (where values for sites are specified with the same order of the property `cartesian_site_positions`)."},"assemblies":{"$ref":"http://onto-ns.com/meta/1.0/OPTIMADEStructureAssembly","type":"ref","description":"A description of groups of sites that are statistically correlated."},"structure_features":{"type":"string","shape":["nstructure_features"],"description":"A list of strings that flag which special features are used by the structure."},"immutable_id":{"type":"string","description":"The entry's immutable ID (e.g., an UUID).
